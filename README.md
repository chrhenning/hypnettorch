# Hypernetworks for PyTorch

[This package](https://hypnettorch.readthedocs.io) contains utilities that make it easy to work with [hypernetworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09106) in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

## Installation

You can either install the latest package version via

```
python3 -m pip install hypnettorch
```

or, you directly install the current sources

```
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/chrhenning/hypnettorch
```

#### Installation for developers

If you actively develop the package, it is easiest to install it in `development mode`, such that all changes that are done to source files are directly visible when you use the package.

Clone the repository to a location of your choice

```
git clone https://github.com/chrhenning/hypnettorch.git
```

and move inside the cloned repo

```
cd ./hypnettorch
```

Now, you can simply **install** the package in `editable` mode, which will ensure that you can easily update the package sources (cf. [development mode](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html))

```
pip3 install --editable . --user
```

Since the package was installed in `editable` mode, you can always update the sources simply by pulling the most recent code

```
git pull
```

You can **uninstall** the package at any point by running `python3 setup.py develop -u`.

## Usage

The basic functionalities of the package are quite intuitive and easy to use, e.g.,

```python
from hypnettorch.mnets import MLP
net = MLP()
```

There are several [tutorials](https://github.com/chrhenning/hypnettorch/tree/master/hypnettorch/tutorials). Check out the [getting started](https://github.com/chrhenning/hypnettorch/blob/master/hypnettorch/tutorials/getting_started.ipynb) tutorial when working with ``hypnettorch`` for the first time.

## Documentation

The documentation can be found [here](https://hypnettorch.readthedocs.io).

#### Note for developers

The documentation can be build using 

```
python3 setup.py build_sphinx
```

and opened via the file [index.html](docs/html/index.html).
